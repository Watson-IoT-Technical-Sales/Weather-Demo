# Weather Demo

This Weather Demo incorporates physical sensor data with The Weather Company weather data to create a solution that automates and optimizes irrigation of farms, parks, etc. It takes into account the temperature, the moisture in the soil, and the current and upcoming weather to decide the best way to engage the irrigation system without wasting water or risking under or over-watering plants.
