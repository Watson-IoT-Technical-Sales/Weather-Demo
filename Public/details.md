##How it Works

The TI Sensor Tag, acting as a temperature and moisture sensor, will detect the current conditions. In conjunction, the back-end application will retrieve real-time      weather data from TWC that will include the Probability of Precipitation (PoP) and the Quantitative Precipitation Forecast (QPF); resulting in a complete understanding of the probability and quantity of incoming rain. The decision engine will then make a decision about whether or not, and how much, to engage irrigation, based on these factors
